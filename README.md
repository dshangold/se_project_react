# Project 10: Weather App

### Overview:

I'm building a weather app that provides weather based on location and provides suggestions on what to wear based on the weather. REACT is the bulding block of this project. Basic html & css is used to build different components of the project and REACT/JS are used throughout for functionality and rendering purposes.

Feel free to provide feedback - always looking to improve!
